Hey Jonatan, sorry about me being unavailable for all this time. I've been working a lot of different things, and t's hard to keep up with everything

[8:18]
I'm looking at your code, great progress

[8:18]
You're definitely on the right track

[8:18]
As for studying JS, I suggest you learn ES6 and how to use tools like webpack, npm/yarn, and a testing framework

[8:19]
This is a great book on ES6 https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read

[8:19]
And it's free

[8:19]
As for webpack, and the others, I usually like to read their docs instead of following articles, because articles are always outdated
